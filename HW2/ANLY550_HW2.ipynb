    "### Problem 1\n",
    "###### First, give an O(nlogk) algorithm to merge k sorted lists with n total elements into one sorted list\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume there is an empty list with size n which is used to store the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Take the first element from each sorted list and use them to build a heap using Build_Max_Heap function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Extract the minimum value from the heap using extract_min function(which is like extract_max, but returns and deletes the minimum value from the heap) and append it on the result list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Take the next element from the list where the minimum value in step 2 comes from, insert it to the heap in the correct place and then go back to step 2 (This process will continue until all lists become empty).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Put the values left in the heap into the list using extract_min function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correctness: The initial max-heap tree has the largest number in the total lists. Everytime we extract $H[1]$ (which is always the largest number in the remaining lists) and insert the exact successor of it in that list into H, we correct the tree. Therefore, the output is from the largest number to the smallest number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of time: Since there are $k$ elements used to build the initial heap in step 1, step 1 will take $O(k)$ and there are $n-k$ elements left. For extract_min function and insert function, both will take $O(logk)$ for each time. Since there are $n-k$ elements left, we will use insert for $n-k$ times and use extract_min for $n-k+k=n$ times. Therefore, the total time is $O(k-klogk+2nlogk)=O(nlogk)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Second, give an O(nlogk) algorithm for sorting a list of n numbers that is k-close to sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume there is an empty list with size n which is used to store the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Take the first $k+1$ elements from the list and use them to build a heap using Build_Max_Heap function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Extract the minimum value from the heap using extract_min function and append it on the result list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Take an element from the list and insert it to the heap in the correct place and then go back to step 2 (this step will continue until the list is empty).\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Put the values left in the heap into the result list using extract_min function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis: Since there are $k+1$ elements used to build the initial heap in step 1, step 1 will take $O(k+1)$ and there are $n-k-1$ elements left. For extract_min function and insert function, both will take $O(logk)$ for each time. Since there are $n-k-1$ elements left, we will use insert for $n-k-1$ times and use extract_min for $n$ times. Therefore, the total time is $O(k+1-klogk-logk+2nlogk)=O(nlogk)$."

Since we want to count the inversions, we need to add a counter to the mergesort function that counts the numebr of inversions everytime call merge function to sort two sorted arrays and sum up those inversions.\n",

We should sum up inversions everytime we compare $left[0]$ and $right[0]$.\n",

    "Assume graph G is undirected, and there is a cross edge (v, w). Since cross edge is these go from “right to left”– there is no ancestral relation (from lecture3), it means w has been visited and all edges going from w have been processed too, which means the edge (w, v) is also been processed. Since v has not been visited at that time, (w, v) is a tree edge and (v, w) must be a back edge. Therefore, there is a contradiction for the assumption. As a result, if a graph G is undirected, then any depth first search of G will never encounter a cross edge."

After initializing all of the vertices, we scan the buckets from $0$ to $|V-1|m$. When a non-empty bucket is encountered, the first vertex is removed, and all adjacent vertices are relaxed. This step is repeated until we have reached the end of the queue: this process takes $O(|V|m)$. Therefore, the total time is $O(|E| + |V|m)$"
