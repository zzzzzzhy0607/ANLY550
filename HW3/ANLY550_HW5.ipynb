    "### Problem 1\n",
    "Prove that there is a unique minimum spanning tree on a connected undirected graph when the edge weights are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proof: Assume there are two minimum spanning tree $T_1$ and $T_2$ for this connected undirected graph with unique edge weights. Since every edge has different weight, the edge $e_1$ with the minimum weight must in $T_1$ or $T_2$. Assume it is in $T_1$, then $T_2 \\cup e_1$ must generate a cycle. In this cycle, we know there is an $e_2 \\in T_2$ and $e_2 \\notin T_1$, since edge weights are unique, and we know $weight(e_1) < weight(e_2)$. Thus $T_2 \\cup e_1 \\backslash \\{e_2\\}$ will generate a spinning tree $T_3$, and $T_3$ has a smaller weight than $T_2$, which means $T_2$ is not a minimum spanning tree. Since there is a contradiction, our original assumption is not true. As a result, there is a unique minimum spanning tree on a connected undirected graph when the edge weights are unique."

    "Suppose we want to print a paragraph neatly on a page. The paragraph consists of words of length $l_1,l_2,...,l_n$. The maximum line length is $M$ . (Assume $l_i \\le M$ always.) We define a measure of neatness as follows. The extra space on a line (using one space between words) containing words $l_i$ through $l_j$ is $M − j + i − \\sum^j_{k=i} l_k$. The penalty is the sum over all lines except the last of the cube of the extra space at the end of the line. This has been proven to be an effective heuristic for neatness in practice. Find a dynamic programming algorithm to determine the neatest way to print a paragraph. Of course you should provide a recursive definition of the value of the optimal solution that motivates your algorithm."
